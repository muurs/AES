# AES
This is a straightforward implementation of the AES encryption scheme. There are no hardening techniques, wich make it highly insecure but also easy to understand (compared to real-world implementations found in, for example, OpenSSL or GnuPG). Most functions provide pointers to the AES standard for those interested.
